        <p class="hero-lead">
          A card comparison “hub” is a structured starting point: instead of random lists, it groups cards into themed pages – travel, rewards, protections, technology, credit score and more – so you can compare features that matter for you.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Credit-Card Hub?</h2>
      <p>A <strong>credit-card hub</strong> is a central page or site that connects multiple sub-pages about different types of cards and features. Instead of mixing everything together, the hub works like a map: travel cards in one place, cashback cards in another, technology and virtual cards in a third.</p>
      <p>For users, this makes it easier to move from <em>“I need a card for X”</em> to the right comparison page, without reading through hundreds of unrelated offers. For publishers, hubs help keep the structure transparent, instead of burying key details behind aggressive marketing.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Structure & navigation -->
    <section id="structure" class="section">
      <h2>How Themed Hubs Are Structured</h2>
      <p>Most serious comparison hubs follow a few simple patterns:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Clear themes:</strong> travel &amp; FX, rewards, protections, business, student, technology, credit score and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Separation of education and comparison:</strong> guides explain concepts, while hub pages compare card features.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistent layouts:</strong> similar tables, feature lists and disclaimers make it easier to scan across pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Visible methodology:</strong> users can see how rankings or highlight decisions are made, not just a “top 10” list.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On a well-built hub, you can move from an educational guide straight into a relevant comparison page — then click through to issuer documentation when you are ready.</p>

      <h2>Examples of Themed Hubs Under One Network</h2>
      <p>Here is how a single network might organise hubs into clear categories:</p>
      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Hub Theme</th>
              <th>What It Covers</th>
              <th>Typical Questions It Answers</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Travel &amp; FX</td>
              <td>Foreign exchange fees, ATM withdrawals abroad, lounges and bundled travel insurance.</td>
              <td>“Which card is best to use when I travel, considering fees and perks?”</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Rewards &amp; Loyalty</td>
              <td>Points, miles, cashback structures and connections to airline or hotel programs.</td>
              <td>“Should I focus on points, miles or simple cashback for my spending pattern?”</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Protections &amp; Insurance</td>
              <td>Purchase protection, extended warranty, chargeback rights and travel cover.</td>
              <td>“What happens if my trip is cancelled or a purchase arrives damaged?”</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Technology &amp; Payments</td>
              <td>Virtual cards, tap-to-pay, digital wallets, crypto-linked cards and security controls.</td>
              <td>“How do these new payment tools actually work with my card?”</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Credit Score &amp; Profiles</td>
              <td>Rebuild, secured and first-card products for different credit profiles.</td>
              <td>“What kinds of cards exist for someone with limited or damaged credit history?”</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p class="small">
        The exact number of hubs and how they are named depends on the network. The key is that structure stays transparent and educational, not just promotional.
